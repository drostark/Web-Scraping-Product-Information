Project Name
Scraping Product Information from E-commerce Website and Saving to CSV

Overview
This Python project demonstrates how to scrape product information from an e-commerce website and save it to a CSV file. It utilizes the requests library for sending HTTP requests, the beautifulsoup4 library for parsing HTML content, and the csv library for working with CSV files. The scraped data includes product name, price, and description.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
requests library: Install using pip install requests
beautifulsoup4 library: Install using pip install beautifulsoup4
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Open the Python script file scrape_product_info.py in your preferred Python IDE or editor.
Modify the following variables to suit your requirements:
url: Replace with the URL of the target e-commerce website.
product_elements: Update with the appropriate HTML element and class for the product listings.
name, price, description: Adjust the HTML elements used to extract the product details.
filename: Provide the desired filename for the CSV file.
fields: Customize the fields/columns for the CSV.
Run the Python script.
The extracted product information will be saved to a CSV file with the specified filename in the same directory as the script.
Important Notes
Respect the website's terms of service and guidelines for web scraping.
